## <p align="center">Welcome to the CBT Login Verification Chrome Extension!</p>

This Chrome extension will monitor the loggedInEmail ID in the CBT app. If this ID does not match the specified email address, it will alert you by changing the background color of the current page.

How to Install & Setup
* Clone this repo into the darkest recess of your drive and open CONTENT.js

* To enable this for your specific account, enter your email on line 9 of the CONTENT.js file.

* Now, head to Chrome and navigate to "chrome://extensions/"

 * In the top right, enable "Developer mode", then on the left, click on "Load Unpacked" and select the installation dungeon this repo is located. 

 That should be it! If you log in as someone else and refresh the page it should be a shade of yellow. 
 
 If you don't like the background color, go [HERE](https://www.google.com/search?q=css+color+picker&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS889US889&oq=css&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j35i39j0l2j69i60j69i61j69i60.2004j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), grab a color and enter it in line 14 of the CONTENT.js file.
