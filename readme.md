### Welcome to the CBT Login Verification Chrome Extension!

# This is a Chrome extension that will monitor the loggedInEmail ID in the CBT app. If this ID does not match your 
# provided email address, it will change the background color of the page to alert you of this. 

# To start, clone this repo into the darkest recess of your drive and open CONTENT.JS

# To enable this for your specific account, enter your email on line 13 of the CONTENT.JS file.

# Now, head to Chrome and navigate to "chrome://extensions/"

# In the top left, click on "Load Unpacked" and select the installation dungeon this repo is located.

# That should be it! If you log in as someone else and refresh the page it should be a shade of yellow.

# Party on!
